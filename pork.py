Pork, a Zork like game about a pig named Hammy
This is the main file which starts and runs the game itself
Map movement is done through a seperate file name porklogic.py

Tracking player health game over condition here
Currently I do not think this is actually working, maybe move to this
function over to porklogic?

if health <= 0:
  print("You have become bacon!")
  break
