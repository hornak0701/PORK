'''
Test module created to test various aspect of PORK
Running this script should prompt user for desired tests
The user can enter the file or events they want to test
Perhaps testing can be automated as more features are added
And maybe testing could even be seperate from development
Initial code by coderchameleon

# This doesn't work like I expected. Currently, in order to run tests scripts, pork.gametitle() must be commented out
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
'''
Currently this seems to just call and run the main pork.py script that then just launches the game as normal
This could maybe indicate an issue with how the game in launched from pork.py --> porklogic.py
as that seens to be indicated by the comment above on line 49 but that is not known for sure right now
